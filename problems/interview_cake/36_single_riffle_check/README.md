# Single Riffle Check

I figured out how to get rich: online poker.
I suspect the online poker game I'm playing shuffles cards by doing a single "
riffle."

To prove this, let's write a function to tell us if a full deck of cards
shuffled_deck is a single riffle of two other halves half1 and half2.

We'll represent a stack of cards as a list of integers in the range 1..52
(since there are 52 distinct cards in a deck).
